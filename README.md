### Hey there! 🙋‍♀️, I'm Kelsea 🎈
#### Based in New York City ~
##### Full-Stack Developer
I took my first steps into Web Development, designing websites for small business owners. With a curiosity about what was happening under the hood, I dived into the world of programming. I quickly discovered my preference for coding and fell in love debugging and cracking problems. I like my code functional and structured and continue to dig deeper into more tools and technologies to further my frontend and backend knowledge.
